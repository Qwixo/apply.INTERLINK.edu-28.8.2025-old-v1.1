  “I know this decision can feel overwhelming. I've spoken to so many students over the years who were unsure about their English, their future, or whether they could actually succeed in the U.S.
  <br /><br />
  Some of them didn’t believe studying in the US was possible for them. Others were confused about how to make it happen. But I’ve seen how things change when students get the right support. Confidence grows, progress happens. and dreams start to feel real.
  <br /><br />
  That’s what we’re here for at INTERLINK. We'll help you every step of the way -- from your application and visa interview, to arriving in the US and starting your English journey, all the way through to transitioning to university classes. You don’t have to figure this out alone — we’ll guide you step-by-step.
  <br /><br />
  If you're reading this, it means you're already considering taking a big step for your future. I’d love to help you make it happen.
  <br /><br />
  Feel free to email me at admissions@interlink.edu and I'll be more than happy to help - I speak English and Spanish too! :)”
